# Descend
## Game Summary Pitch:
Descend is a 2D Topdown Rougelike Metroid-vania Dungeon crawler where you have to descend into the Dungeon, collect Treasures and Fight Monsters
## Inspiration
- Hollow Knight
- Dungeon Clawler

## Story:
Long ago, an ancient civilization constructed the Spirea monolithic tower buried upside down into the earth, its vast halls sinking into endless darkness. It was a prison and a vault, locking away gods, monsters, and memories of a world before the Collapse.

Now, ages have passed. The ancient civilization is long buried beneath myth and ruin, its name lost to time. The Spire remains—a living relic twisted by arcane forces. Each descent reshapes its interior: corridors reconfigure, rooms shift, and the creatures within mutate into new horrors. Reality itself bends under the weight of the ancient spells still pulsing deep within the stone.

You're no legend. No prophecy hangs over your head. You’re just another adventurer—broke, armed, and desperate. The Spire is a job. It's a place where coin can still be pried from the bones of the past, if you're fast, clever, or lucky enough to survive. Most don’t. But someone always needs a cut of treasure or a scrap of power, and there’s always another poor soul willing to go deeper than the last.
